# Football Analysis System 



detect and track players, referees and football across the whole video 

using YOLO -> there is a better way to do that ? 

assign players to team -> T-shirt color 
segment -> cluster pixels with k means -> T-shirt pixels from the players -> other one ? 

-> ball control 

optical flow -> how much camera movement -> player's movements 

prospective transformation -> camera distorted view of the 3D world -> represent the scene depth and perspective -> how much players move in meters not in pixels 

-> players speed 

## Dataset 

The dataset is taken from the Kaggle competition [DFL - Bundesliga Data Shootout](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dfl-bundesliga-data-shootout/overview), which is a short video of 30 minutes of football matches.
